# Validate DESIGN.md against the DESIGN.md token format.

# Run from the repository root.
#
# `design.md lint` exits 0 whatever it finds, and warns for anything its schema does not know:
# an unrecognised component property, a colour no component references, a missing section. A
# token an agent cannot read is a token this file cannot claim to define, so warnings fail here
# too, and an unknown rule from a future release fails by default.
#
# The one exception is `contrast-ratio`, which judges in WCAG 2. This system judges in APCA
# (DESIGN.md → Colors) because WCAG 2 misreads light text on a #010102 canvas, and APCA is the
# stricter of the two on these tokens: ink-subtle passes WCAG AA at 5.86:1 while APCA puts it
# below the body-text floor. Those findings print, every run, but do not fail the build.
